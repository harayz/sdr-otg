Please excuse me while i kiss the sky the mess. Should you be interested to help out, feel free to email me or come back for further instructions. \r\n\r\n- Project Readiness  : 7%\r\n- Estimate Timeline : December 2016\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n* Idea Information - wikis \r\n* Operating System - Beta Version\r\n* Hardware Modules - IPO (input + process + output)\r\n* Ext Intergration - software + hardware + mobile + online\r\n* xxxxxxxxxxx xxxx - tba\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### User Interface\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Packages Included\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Atrributing Works\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contribute Contact \r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
